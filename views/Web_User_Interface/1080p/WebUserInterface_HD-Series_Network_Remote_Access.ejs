The only way to get complete access to all your camera´s functions is called DDNS. The DDNS or Internet Address gives you access to your cameras web user interface.

Everything you need for a remote access to your camera is a <a href="/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding">port forwarding rule</a> in your router. You can access your camera afterwards through the internet using this http address. Please visit the DDNS section for detailed information on the <a href="/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding">port forwarding</a> setup as well as video instruction for many common routers. Or refer to your router’s user manual for further guidelines on how to set up a port forwarding rule.</p>

By doing so you will temporarily <strong>deactivate your INSTAR DDNS address</strong>. In case you are using several cameras behind a single internet access point, please set up the third party address in <strong>only one</strong> of the cameras. Or if possible directly inside your router! All your cameras will be accessible through this address - just assign a unique HTTP port to every camera. For example if camera 1 is assigned the HTTP port 85 and camera 2 the HTTP port 86, use myaddress.dyndns.org:85 to reach camera 1 and myaddresse.dyndns.org:86 to be forwarded to camera 2.</p>
