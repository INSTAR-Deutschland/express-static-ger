                      <h3>Use an external Sensor</h3>
                      <p>You can use a motion detector like the <a href="/Products/IN-Motion">IN-Motion 500</a> to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-6014 HD. Simply connect the sensor to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&amp;4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected.</p>

The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise.<br/><br/>Once you coupled both detection methods, you always have to deactivate both to deactivate the motion detection!</p>

                      <p>Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm motor of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor.<br/><br/>By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts.</p>

                      <p>The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate External Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&amp;2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current / 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.</p>
