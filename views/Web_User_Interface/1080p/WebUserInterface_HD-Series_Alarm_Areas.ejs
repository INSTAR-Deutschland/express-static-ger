                        <p>In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms. In this case please refer to Actions Menu for employing a PIR motion detector..</p>

                        <p>The smaller an area, the bigger (in percent) a change in the image will be. Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above.</p>

                        <p>A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate.<br/><br/>
                        To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door.<br/><br/>
                        The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/System/Log/">System Log</a>. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity.</p>
