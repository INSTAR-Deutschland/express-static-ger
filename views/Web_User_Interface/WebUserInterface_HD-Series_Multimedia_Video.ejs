This Motion-JPEG Stream has the advantage, that it can be displayed in every web browser without the need for a video plugin. This is necessary if you want to see the live video on a computer where you don´t have the rights to install a browser plugin, e.g. your company PC. The disadvantage of this mode is that the compression is a lot weaker and you will need a lot more bandwidth.

Please be aware that this is only a theoretical maximum that you don´t want your camera to exceed. The actual framerate might be bottlenecked by your camera´s network connection and the exposure time of the image sensor (the darker the image becomes, the longer the image sensor has to collect light and the longer it takes to create a frame). The framerate is suitable to set an upper limit to the bandwidth requirement of your camera, to prevent a network overload. The default value of <strong>15 fps</strong> is usually a workable compromise for most surveillance tasks.</td>

Increasing the bitrate will massively increase the bandwidth requirements for accessing the stream over the local network and will also increase the file size of recorded videos. A significant advantage in image quality will only be achieved, if the video contains a lot of fine details. In most cases it is recommended to leave this value at it´s default of <strong>1024-2048kbps</strong>.</td>

This will effect the file size of recorded videos, the processor load of your camera, as well as the bandwidth requirements of the live stream.

Hence I frames are typically 10x larger than P frames, so the fewer you have, the more compression you can get. As a compromise between image quality and bandwidth requirement, it is recommended to create about 1 keyframe every second. With the default intervall of <strong>20 frames</strong> and a framerate of 15fps, your camera will send an I-Frame every (20 Frames/15 Frames/s) = 1.33s.</td>

The ActiveX Plugin can only be used under Windows with the Internet Explorer or Firefox Browser, but offers <a href="/Web_User_Interface/720p_Series/Video_Menu_Bar/">few adavantages</a> over the other plugins.
