    "description": "1080p Camera Series - To activate the motion detection, open the web interface of your INSTAR HD IP camera and click on the menu Alarm / Areas. Now that we set the motion detection areas, we can continue with adding actions, the camera has to take, in case of an detection event. Open the Alarm Actions menu to configure the alarm actions. To use the email notification, you first have to set your email login credentials inside the System Email. Please follow our Alarm Notification Guide. All video and snapshot recordings to SD card, can be accessed by our free app for Windows Phone, Windows Metro, Android, iPhone and iPad. Alternatively, you can download all files to your computer. To use the FTP server upload, you first have to set your server information inside the Network FTP menu. You can, for example, use your Router or NAS as FTP Server. Or run a FTP Server on your Windows PC. It is recommended to use the integrated Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) in combination (Link with Areas) with your motion detection areas, to filter out false alerts caused by e.g. rain, snow or changes in the lighting condition. You can also deactivate the detection areas and use the PIR sensor by itself. Attention: If you have problems by receiving to many alarms you can solve that by changing your settings. Always set the sensitivity so that the motion you want to detect is detected by the camera - simply test it by walking in front of your camera. If this does not trigger an alert, you can either increase the sensitivity of the detection, or decrease the size of the detection area - the smaller the area, the higher, procentually, is the change of pixels inside the area by the event. On the other hand, if you have to increase the detection area, you also have to increase the sensitivity of the detection. To avoid unwanted motion detection please avoid covering areas like the sky with moving clouds, busy streets in the background or big reflecting areas. To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. It is usually recommended to combine the software-based detection with the integrated PIR sensor of your camera.",

By simply clicking into the picture and dragging your mouse you can choose the area for motion detection. The motion detection will be armed in the area you have selected. In case you want to select the whole area you can click Full Area on the right side in order to activate the motion detection over the whole picture. Now you can use the slide bar to set the sensitivity for the motion. 1 = Insensitive (almost no motion gets detected) 100 = Very Sensitive (almost every motion will be recorded) We recommend you so leave the motion sensitivity at 50 and slowly test which setting will deliver the best result. Repeat the above steps in case you want to set more then one area. Each area will be given a different colour: Area 1 = red Area 2 = blue Area 3 = green Area 4 = yellow Submit the settings in order to save all settings in the camera.

The cameras integrated motion detection only works over the whole picture. With our additional software InstarVision for Windows computers you can define different areas in the picture for which you want to use motion detection. That means not the whole picture will be included in the motion detection but only the areas you have selected. For other operating system we currently have to use third party developers such as the software Motion, EvoCam, ZoneMinder, VitaminD and many others. The use of third party software is no problem with our cameras since they are integrated in most software versions. If you find that our cameras are not integrated you can contact us anytime so we can arrange the integration. Please note that the software of third party developers are only working with the livestream of the camera. So in order to use the functions offered by the third party software you need to have your computer running and the software opened. Attention: If you have problems by receiving to many alarms you can solve that by changing your settings. Always set the sensitivity so that the motion you want to detect is detected by the camera - simply test it by walking in front of your camera. If this does not trigger an alert, you can either increase the sensitivity of the detection, or decrease the size of the detection area - the smaller the area, the higher, procentually, is the change of pixels inside the area by the event.

To avoid unwanted motion detection please avoid covering areas like the sky with moving clouds, busy streets in the background or big reflecting areas. To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. As soon as you camera is detection a motion you have 3 options in order to get a notification or to record the motion: 1. Email: The IP camera will automatically sent you an email with 6 pictures in the attachment. The computer does not need to run for this function since the camera has a direct connection to the router. 2. FTP Upload: The IP camera will sent pictures to your FTP Server. With this function there will be pictures saved for a time period of 1 minute in case of an alarm. The computer does not need to run for this function. Alternative: The FTP Upload gives you the additional function to upload pictures in a fixed time interval. With this function you can for example have one picture saved every 10 seconds for an unlimited time. The picture can either be saved with the same name or the name can be created by the camera automatically by using date and time as the picture name. 3. Video: A 1 minute video can be automatically recorded. This function is only working if you are using the Internet Explorer as a webbrowser since a ActiveX Plugin is necessary to record the video to your computer. So in order to save the video the computer needs to be running and the IP address of the camera has to be opened in Internet Explorer showing the livestream. If you use our addtional software InstarVision you can also record videos. Also you can record them with a high compression and in different video formats in order to save space on your harddrive. Alternative: You can also make a continues recording with the Internet Explorer. Therefor just activate the recording manually by pressing the record button on the upper left side.",

    "description": "Troubleshooting Gmail Problem: You set up a new GMail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: Google monitors your behaviour to estimate if it is really you, who accesses the email account. When you use a new device - e.g. another smartphone or your IP camera - to login to your account, Google might block you and ask for a two stage authentication. This will cause your Test-Email to fail. Please log into your account via your web browser and and check if your GMail account was blocked or Google tells you they caught a suspicious activity. Just authenticate yourself andor the device that caused the activity. Problem: GMail always worked fine, but now you stopped receiving alarm emails. But you are still receiving emails from other senders in your GMail account. Solution: GMail started to limit the amount of emails that you are allowed to send with a free account. Your camera is using the GMail SMTP server to send alarm emails and is therefore using up the amount of mails you are allowed to send. You can set up a separate GMail account for your camera to avoid this interference with your personal emails. Problem: You cannot send a Test Email - the login fails. Solution: Activate the SMTP access for less secure apps. Open on your Email Account menu, choose Account to open your Account Settings and go to the Sign In Settings and allow the access from less secure apps. Telekom Speedport Problem: You are using your camera behind a Telekom Speedport and typed in your SMTP server and login credentials but the Test-Email always fails. Solution: The Telekom Speedport introduced a list of allowed SMTP servers into it´s Firmware, which is activated by default. Even though this list contains most common SMTP servers - it might still interfere with your attempts to contact SMTP servers with your camera. You can deactivate the Email Abuse Detection for a moment (maybe restart your Speedport afterwards) and try again. Deactivate the Mail Abuse Detection and re-try sending your Test-Email. If it works, add your SMTP server address to the list of allowed addresses and activate the function again. T-Online Mail Problem: You set up a new T-Online mail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: You need to set a separate email password for external apps to connect to your T-Online mail account. Log in to your T-Online web account and open then Menu Properties. Go to Passwords and click on Change your Email Password. Follow the instructions and confirm your password. Log into your camera´s WebUI, open the Alarm SMTP Server Overlay and choose the T-Online preset. Type in your complete mail address as username and add the password you created in the step above. Add your T-Online address in the Alarm / Email Overlay and submit and test the connection. GMX Mail Problem: The Test-Email always fails. Solution: You need to activate the SMTP service for external programs like Thunderbird or Outlook.",

INFORMATION ABOUT RECORDING: The recording during an motion detection can only be saved to the SD card inside the camera. This recording mode as explained above is only for manual recordings. The Action which the camera should do during a motion detection can be set in the Alarm Actions Overlay. You can also record the video with our additional software InstarVision or any other third party software. If you are using a QNAP or Synology Disk Station you can also simply add the camera in the Surveillance Software on the Disk Station. VGA Camera Series The camera is using a ActiveX plugin to record videos. this is currently only supported by Internet Explorer. This is why the video recording is only possible with a windows computer. The recordings directory can be set under Alarm Path and the recording be started by clicking on Record above the cameras live video. In order to record in Windows 8 7 Vista you will need to add the IP address of your IP camera to the list of trusted sites. In order to do so please open your Internet Explorer and go to Tools - Internet Options - Security - Trusted sites - Sites to add the IP address of your camera. You will need to remove the checkmark by Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone so that you can add the IP as http. After that please reload the cameras ip address in your web browser and you should be able to set the record path accordingly. If you can still not set the record path please make sure you have started the Internet Explorer with admin rights. The recording with (1 frame per second) is possible if you are recording with FTP upload. The camera can upload a picture every second in case of an alarm. All you need is a FTP server or a network HDD which can also be set with an FTP access. You can also record the video with our additional software InstarVision or any other third party software.

To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Or use a third-party Software to download the video. SD Card Access: The HD camera models use an internal (removable) SD card to record videos, alarm snapshots and whole photo series that can be used for later time lapse conversions. You can access the recorded files directly via the cameras web user interface or with an FTP client. The webUI is the quickest way to download files and screen them on your computer, tablet or smartphone from your default web browser. But FTP clients offer a few features that will be more convenient if you have to go through a large number of files from your SD card. Please be aware that the FTP client has to support the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) to access the SD card. Please be aware that you will only be able to download files - the FTP clients will not offer your WRITE rights on the SD storage! Below you can find a short selection of clients that will work with your INSTAR camera. For indoor models you can always remove the SD card and use it with a card reader on your computer or mobile device for easy access. Web User Interface. The HD camera models allow you to record videos and snapshots to the internal SD card. To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Click on the SD Card link above your cameras live video. Web User Interface. The SD cards file directory will open in a new tab. Please type in your camera login to access your recorded files. If the link is not displayed the SD is no longer mounted by the cameras operating system - please remove the SD card and push it back into the SD card slot. You are able to screen and download your recordings after confirming your camera login. SD Card Index. Your camera generates a new directory for each new day and a new recordXXX directory for every 200 recordings of that day. Every alarm event creates an *.avi file that starts with the capital letter A - planned recordings with the letter P and so on - followed by a timecode for the alarm trigger. File System. The default behavior of most internet browsers is to download the video after you clicked on it. Browsers like the Mozilla Firefox off you support for the VLC plugin to display the video directly inside the browser window. Please make sure that you activate the Firefox plugin during the installation process of the VLC player and restart your browser after the installation.

    "description": "Use your Router NAS as a FTP Server - Local FTP Server. Most modern routers now support USB mass storage devices (USB sticks, hard drives,...) to be plugged in - some even come with a large amount of on-board storage for you to use a Network-Attached-Storage (NAS). This storage spaces can be written on by FTP clients like your INSTAR IP camera. All you need to do is to provide the storage and set up a FTP user inside your router and the camera can send snapshots - or in case of the HD cameras even whole video files - to the router. This can be vital if your camera or the included SD card (HD camera line) gets damaged and you want to figure out what happened. Of course you don´t need to upload those backup files to your local router - if you have a router in a different location, you can easily use it as an off-site storage backup system for your surveillance system! In this case you will have to use a DDNS address (like e.g. DynDNS or No-IP) inside the router for the camera to reach it.

    "description": "AVM Fritzbox as FTP Server - In the following we want to explore the possibility to use an AVM Fritzbox 7490 as our FTP server. The user interface screenshots will only show the AVM UI. But most of the steps we will take are representative for other routers as well. Each time, you will need to define a FTP user and the corresponding access rights inside the router. Then type in the FTP user credentials and the corresponding FTP directory into your camera´s WebUI. Set up an Upload Directory. First we have to set up a directory for your camera´s uploads. Connect an USB thumbdrive or an USB hard drive to the USB port of your router. In case of the Fritzbox simply click on FritzNAS (on top of the screen) to enter the storage overview panel. For other routers it is recommended to check the FTP access with an FTP client like Filezilla Client or simply type in ftp IP of your router 21 into the address bar of your default web browser. Use the camera login we just created to check available storage. If you are using Firefox, you can use a FTP client extension like FireFTP to create a directory that your camera should use to upload files. Once inside the FritzNAS storage overview window, change to your external storage (in our case a ADATA Thumbdrive), click on the New Folder button on top and create a new folder for your camera. Remember the path to your folder as we will have to type it into camera webUI in moment. Be carful not to delete the FRITZ folder, created by your router - if you do, your thumb drive will be unmounted and you have to replug it into the USB Port! Add a directory for your camera on your external storage medium to write her files to. Set up a FTP User - First, we have to find the FTP settings inside the router. For most routers that is pretty straight-forward - just search for the keyword FTP. Unfortunately, AVM decided to hide this function with the newer firmwares, causing us a little bit of a headache. Which is partly the reason why we take the Fritzbox router as the example - the other routers will be much easier to set up. The FTP are now hidden inside the Fritzbox User (Benutzer) tab under System. Click on Add User (Benutzer Hinzufügen) and give your user a name and password. It is recommended to keep the name and password secure but to stay away from exotic characters, which might cause you some trouble. Especially, if you only use the FTP upload inside your local network and you deactivate the access rights from the internet (Zugang aus dem Internet, s. screenshot below). The only thing your cameras needs to have access to is the network attached storage (Zugang zu NAS-Inhalten, s. below). Click on add a directory (Verzeichnis Hinzufügen) and allow the camera to write onto the supplied storage. Add a FTP user on your router so your camera has access to the network attached storage. Choosing Alle an der Fritzbox verfügbaren Speicher allows the camera to write into every directory on your router. It is very important, that the user authentication is active on your router - the camera will not be able to upload the files to the storage otherwise. As seen in the screenshots below, you will now have an administrator account to manage your router as well as the pure FTP user for your camera. You can switch to the tab Anmeldung im Heimnetz to confirm that the authentication is active or not... Well, you will already know if you had to login to your router earlier anyway. Check the screenshots below for the Fritzbox example. Please make sure that you also have a administrator account active and the user authentication is activated - this is very important and a common mistake! Set up your Camera to use the FTP Storage. Now we can access our camera to program it to upload files to our new FTP upload directory in case of an alarm event. Open the web user interface of your camera and navigate to Alarm FTP. The following menu (see 2nd screenshot below) needs to be filled with all the data we just set up inside the router: FTP Server: Is the address of the FTP server. In our case the IP address of our router 192.168.178.1. Please be aware that the IP addresses of routers from different manufactures will vary. Usually it is only the third number that will be different - in most cases it is either 0, 1, 2 or in case of the AVM Fritzbox 178. FTP Port: The default FTP port is 21. FTP Folder: The FTP folder is the upload directory we just set up on our router. Please remember to add a in front of the folder. If you want to upload to the root directory, just put a here. FTP Username: Put in the username we just defined inside the router FTP Password: and add the corresponding password. FTP Mode: The default mode for a local FTP server - that isn´t shielded by a NAT firewall - is PASV. Afterwards click on Submit and Test to check your inputs. Your camera should give you a Successful notification and if you check your upload directory, you will find a snapshot uploaded by the camera. Now you can activate the FTP upload actions in case of an alarm trigger event, to have the camera upload it snapshots or videos to your FTP server. Configure your Camera. Open your cameras web user interface and go to Alarm FTP to input your FTP server information you set up earlier. WebUI Type in your FTP login credentials and server information like described above. Submit before testing the upload. FTP Settings You will find a single snapshot in your upload directory, after successfully testing the FTP connection. Testing Now you can activate the FTP upload functions for alarm trigger events. Alarm Upload",

    "description": "Setting up FTP Access on a Western Digital (WD) MyCloud - Step 1: Open the WD MyCloud in your web browser by typing http wdmycloud.local in the address bar of your web browser. The login to your WD MyCloud should open. Please log in with your admin account. Step 2: In the upper menue please click on the arrow to the right side and select Settings. Step 3: On the left side please click on Network and within the network services please switch the IPv4 Network Mode to static. This is important to make sure that the ip address of your MyCloud is not changing. If you are noting switching it to static, it could be that your router will assign a different IP address to your MyCloud. In this case the camera would not be able to reach it anymore and therefor will not record anymore to the MyCloud. Therefor this step is very important. Step 4: Follow the assistent to assign a static IP address. You actually only have to click on Next and Apply in order to apply the settings. Please remember the IP address shown in Step2. This IP address will be the one with which you can access your WD MyCloud at any time. Step 5: You have to login again once the IP has been changed to a static IP. Please login in again. Once logged in, please click the right arrow again in the upper menue and click on Settings. Step 6: Once again select Network and within the network services please switch the FTP Access to ON. ON should then be shown in blue. Step 7: The FTP Access in general is now activated. In order to tell the camera in which folder it should record, we will need to set up a shared Folder. Therefor please click on Shares in the upper menue and inside this menue please click on the + sign in order to add a shared Folder. Step 8: For Share Name you can now type in the folder name in which you want the recordings beeing stored. In our case we choose the folder name Recordings. You can also add a description to the folder name. In our case we name it INSTAR Cameras. Once you typed in the Share Name and Desciption please Apply the settings. Step 9: The newly created shared Folder should now already be selected. In order to be able to access it by FTP, you will need to activate the FTP access. Please activate it. Now you still need to choose if a anonymous user can access the folder or not, in this case we recomment you to select Anonoymous None which means that noone can access the recordings besides you. Once done please click Apply. Step 10: Finally we have to set up our camera by typing in all the FTP data. To do so, please open the web interface of your INSTAR camera. You can either type in the IP address of your camera in the address bar of your web browser, or you can use the INSTAR camera tool to search for your camera and to open it in the default web browser. Once it is opened, please click on „Alarm – FTP“ on the left menue bar to open the FTP settings. Step 11: In the FTP mask please fill in the following data: FTP Server: Here you will need to type in the IP address of your WD MyCloud. As an alternative you can also type in wdmycloud.local FTP Port: Please leave it Port 21 which is used for FTP. FTP Folder: You will have to type in the folder name which you have created before as a shared Folder on your MyCloud. In our case it was the folder Recordings. If you are having more then one camera, we recommend you to also add another sub folder for each camera, in our case Camera_LivingRoom. This way it will be easier later to seperate between the different cameras. FTP Username: The username of your WD MyCloud. FTP Password: The password of your WD MyCloud. FTP Mode: Please keep this PASV Mode. FTP Folder Structure: Here you can select if the camera shoudl record everything in one single folder, or if the camera should create a new folder for each day. If the camera created a new folder for each day, each folder will me named according to the date. Therefor it will be much easier later to search for a recording from a particular day. Submit your settings and test them. If the test is successful, your camera should now be able to save the recordings on your WD MyCloud. Please dont forget to activate the motion detection (alarm areas) inside your camera and also make sure you activate the FTP upload under Alarm – Actions. Here you can select if the camera should Upload videos or images to the FTP server (WD MyCloud) in case of an alarm event. If you activate everything accordingly, the recordings should now be saved on your WD MyCloud.",

Your camera can upload pictures during an alarm event or you can also upload pictures in a defined time period to any kind of FTP server. Besides online offers for FTP servers or Routers which can function as a FTP server you can also set up your local computer or server to function as a FTP server in order to receive pictures from the camera. Download FileZilla Server. All you need to do is get a FTP tool like FileZilla: Enter the Filezilla website (1) and download the server edition of FileZilla (2). Install the Server. If you run into any troubles during the installation process, please follow our installation guide HERE. Start the Server. After installation please start the FTP server and connect to your localhost (127.0.0.1) server. Add a FTP User: Now please set up a user for your cameras account. By clicking Edit and then Users you can access the user settings. In General (1) please choose Add (2) and type in a user name for your cameras account (3). After that you can choose a password for this account (4) and click OK to save the settings. Add a local Directory: Now we have to select the folder in which the camera will save the pictures. Please choose Shared folders and then Add to select the folder in which the pictures will be saved on your local hard drive. After selection the folder please mark the folder and set it as the Home Directory by clicking set as home dir. Please also make sure that under Files the Read and Write access rights are selected.

    "description": "Alarm Server Function - You can use the Alarm Server function to send a http request to a connected server. The server needs a compatible software to recognize this request as an alarm event and trigger further actions. This function is often supported by home alarm systems. You can add custom commands to the request to trigger specific actions in the receiving server software. Add an Alarm Server: Open the web user interface of your (VGA!) camera and navigate to Alarm Alarm Server. Type in your in your alarm server address and activate the function. Please add the http prefix when entering the servers IP address - e.g. http: 192.168.1.66. Application: The Alarm Server function can be used with alarm systems and home automations like the Open Source project FHEM. Unfortunately, because those home automation systems insist on using SPACEs in their URLs, programing your camera becomes a little bit more complicated. As I am writing this article we are already testing a new version of the web user interface for our VGA camera´s that will make the work-around below superfluous. The following will show you how you are able to determin, if your camera is handling the command correctly and how to prepare your command to bypass the problem in case the camera is not saving it as expected. Home automation system´s like FHEM use SPACEs in their URLs that have to be encoded as %20. You have to use a so called URL encoding to employ SPACEs in your web address. An example command for the home automation system FHEM is set alarm on to trigger an alarm event. This will encode to set%20alarm%20on for the camera. The receiving FHEM server will then decode the %20 back to a SPACE. If, for example, your (FHEM) alarm server has the local IP address 192.168.1.66 inside your network, the Server Address you have to type in your cameras webUI to have it activate the alarm event will be. http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%20alarm%20on (The maximal length of the URL is 128 characters) You can check if the command was saved correctly by calling your cameras configuration with the CGI command http: 192.168.1.230 get_params.cgi (where 192.168.1.230 has to be changed to the IP address of your IP camera. You will be asked to log in with your camera administrator account, if you are not logged in already. Scroll to the bottom of the parameter list and search for the variable alarm_http_url. You can check if the server address and FHEM command was saved correctly by calling the cameras configuration page with the CGI command get_params.cgi. The server address has to be saved with the %20 encoding. Every time an alarm is triggered inside the camera the HTTP request will be send to your home automation server, triggering your custom command. Troubleshooting: What to do if your camera does not save the command with the %20 URL encoding? As mentioned above, you might already be using a camera where the web user interface takes care of the encoding for you and the command is saved correctly - please skip this paragraph if this is the case. In the following we will employ a little trick to make the encoding for us instead of against us. What to do if the CGI command get_params.cgi shows you that the camera saved the command with SPACEs instead of the %20 encoding?. Your camera will now send out the HTTP request every time the alarm is triggered. But the request will be cut before the first SPACE - making it basically useless. We can fix this dilemma by having the automatic URL encoding generate the correct URL for us. This can be done by encoding the % sign to %25. The server address will become: http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%2520alarm%2520on The automatic encoding will generate the correct address from it once you submit this address: http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%20alarm%20on To prevent this from happening, encode the SPACE with %2520 instead of %20.Please make sure not to press the Submit button a second time - as this will again get rid of the %20, substituting it with a SPACE. You can check the result by calling the get_params.cgi command.",

    "description": "Cloud - Benutzer erstellen Erstellen eines Benutzers in der Cloud Schritt 1 Um sich an der INSTAR Cloud anmelden zu können, müssen Sie sich zuerst mit Ihrer Emailadresse und einem von Ihnen ausgewählten Kennwort registrieren. Gehen Sie dazu auf cloud.instar.de und wählen Sie dort „Jetzt kostenfrei registrieren“ aus. Schritt 2 Tragen Sie jetzt Ihre Emailadresse sowie Ihr gewünschtes Passwort ein und klicken Sie dann auf „Jetzt kostenfrei registrieren“. Sie erhalten anschließend eine Email von uns in der Sie die Registrierung nochmals bestätigen müssen. Nachdem Sie die Registrierung bestätigt haben, können Sie sich anschließend dann mit Ihrem Account an der INSTAR Cloud anmelden. Schritt 3 Nachdem Sie sich angemeldet haben, kommen Sie normalerweise auf die Übersicht aller neuen Alarme. Dadurch das Sie aber noch keine Kamera angelegt haben bei einer neuen Registrierung, werden Sie zuerst auf den Menüpunkt „Kameras“ weitergeleitet. Dort haben Sie jetzt die Möglichkeit eine neue Kamera in Ihren Cloud Account hinzuzufügen. Schritt 4 Wenn Sie eine neue Kamera hinzufügen, müssen Sie als erstes dieser Kamera einen Namen vergeben. In unserem Beispiel vergeben wir der Kamera den Namen „Büro DE“. Zudem müssen Sie auswählen ob es sich bei Ihrer Kamera um eine HD Kamera oder eine VGA Kamera handelt. Um die Kamera anzulegen klicken Sie jetzt bitte auf Kamera anlegen. Schritt 5 Die Kamera wird jetzt angelegt und Sie bekommen alle nötigen Zugangsdaten zu dieser Kamera angezeigt. In der Übersicht erhalten Sie folgende Informationen: Kameraname: (Dies ist der Name den Sie der Kamera vergeben haben, über Bearbeiten kann dieser jederzeit geändert werden.) Kameratyp: Die Art der Kamera, je nach dem ob Sie eine VGA oder HD Kamera ausgewählt haben. Aufnahmen: Die Anzahl der Alarmvideos die für diese Kamera existieren. Letzte Aktivität: Die letzte Aktivität in der die Kamera einen Alarm gemeldet aufgenommen hat. Kamera-Set: Sofern Sie Kamera einem oder mehreren Sets zugewiesen ist. Mehr dazu finden Sie im Kapitel Sets anlegen. Cloud Benutzer: Den Benutzernamen für diese Kamera den Sie in der Weboberfläche Ihrer Kamera hinterlegen müssen. ACHTUNG: Bitte stellen Sie zuvor sicher, das Sie die neueste Firmware auf Ihrer Kamera installiert haben damit Sie den Menüpunkt Cloud in der Weboberfläche angezeigt bekommen. Cloud Passwort: Das Passwort welches in der Weboberfläche Ihrer Kamera hinterlegt werden muss, damit sich die Kamera an der Cloud anmelden kann. Schritt 6 Öffnen Sie jetzt die Weboberfläche Ihrer IP Kamera. Stellen Sie wie gesagt sicher, dass Sie die allerneueste Firmware auf Ihrer Kamera installiert haben. Sofern Sie die neueste Firmware installiert haben, sehen Sie auf der linken Seite einen neuen Menüpunkt „Cloud“. Bitte wählen Sie diesen aus und gehen Sie dort auf den Unterpunkt „Einstellungen“. In dem Menü welches sich jetzt öffnet können Sie den „Cloud Transfer aktivieren“ auswählen damit die Kamera ab sofort die Alarmvideos an die Cloud überträgt. Zudem müssen Sie hier jetzt Ihren Benutzernamen und Passwort hinterlegen den Sie in Ihrem Cloud Account angezeigt bekommen. Kopieren Sie diesen am besten und achten Sie darauf das Sie nicht versehentlich ein Leerzeichen mit kopieren / einfügen. Zu guter letzt Bestätigen Sie bitte die Einstellungen damit diese in der Kamera gespeichert werden. Schritt 7 Damit ein Alarm ausgelöst wird bei einer Bewegung, muss natürlich noch die Bewegungserkennung aktiviert werden. Dies tun Sie wie gehabt über „Alarm – Bereiche“ sofern Sie die softwareseitige Bewegungserkennung verwenden. Sollten Sie einen PIR Sensor verwenden, dann aktivieren Sie diesen bitte entsprechend unter Alarm – Aktionen. Nachdem Sie die Bewegungserkennung aktiviert haben (in unserem Beispiel überwachen wir die Tür und haben diese entsprechend ausgewählt), Bestätigen Sie die Einstellungen bitte unten rechts. Schritt 8 Sofern die Kamera jetzt Alarme auslöst, werden Sie diese kurze Zeit später in Ihrem Cloud Account unter „Alarme“ finden. Sofern Sie mehrere Kameras in der Cloud hinzugefügt haben, können Sie auf der linken Seite jeweils die einzelnen Kameras auswählen um nur die Aufnahmen der jeweils ausgewählten Kamera zu sehen.",

    "description": "Cloud - Speicherplatz hinzubuchen Jeder neu angelegte Cloud Account erhält standardmäßig einen 1GB Speicher für 14 Tage um die Cloud ausgiebig testen zu können. Sofern Ihnen die INSTAR Cloud gefällt, würden wir uns natürlich freuen, wenn Sie Ihren Speicherplatz entsprechend erweitern. Dies können Sie ganz einfach durch Gutscheincodes tun, welche Sie direkt auf der INSTAR Webseite erwerben können. Siehe: INSTAR Webseite Mehr Speicherplatz buchen Schritt 1 Melden Sie sich mit Ihrem Cloud Account an und gehen Sie dort auf „Administration – Speicherplan“. Hier sehen Sie Ihren aktuellen Speicherplatz sowie die Laufzeit für welche dieser gültig ist. Schritt 2 Um jetzt Ihren Speicherplatz zu verlängern bzw. zu vergrößern, kaufen Sie zuerst entsprechenden Speicherplatz über die INSTAR Webseite. Der Speicherplatz ist immer in Einheiten von 10GB. Sollten Sie z.B. 20GB kaufen, dann können Sie im ersten Schritt 10GB Ihrem Account hinzufügen und im zweiten Schritt können Sie die zweiten 10GB entweder zur Verlängerung Ihrer Laufzeit verwenden oder um den Speicherplatz zu vergrößern auf 20GB. Dies können Sie frei wählen. Kopieren Sie den Gutscheincode für Ihre Speichereinheit den Sie von uns nach dem Kauf per Email erhalten und fügen Sie den Gutscheincode in Ihrem Cloud Account ein und wählen Sie dann „Gutschein prüfen“. Schritt 3 Sofern der Gutscheincode gültig ist, wird Ihr Account jetzt auf 10GB erweitert. Eine 10GB Einheit hat immer eine Laufzeit von 365 Tagen welches Sie in Ihrem Account dann auch entsprechend angezeigt bekommen. Schritt 4 Sollten Sie sich dazu entscheiden eine zweite 10GB Einheit Ihrem Account hinzuzufügen, dann können Sie wie zuvor erwähnt wählen, ob Sie den Speicherplatz erweitern oder die Laufzeit verlängern möchten. In unserem Beispiel erweitern wir einmal den Speicherplatz. Schritt 5 Unter dem Punkt „Warnen bei benutztem Speicherplatz von:“ können Sie einstellen ab welchem Zeitpunkt Sie eine Warnung erhalten möchten. Wenn Sie z.B. mehrere Kameras in der Cloud hinzugefügt haben und der Speicherplatz fast voll ist, dann können Sie einstellen ab welchem Zeitpunkt Sie eine Email erhalten möchten mit dem Hinweis das entweder Videos gelöscht werden müssen oder der Speicherplatz erweitert werden muss. Sie haben zudem die Möglichkeit unter „Administration – Alarme“ das automatische löschen zu aktivieren. Dies erklären wir Ihnen im Punkt 4. Administration und Übersicht der möglichen Einstellmöglichkeiten. Allgemeine Info Sie müssen in der INSTAR Cloud lediglich schauen, das Sie genügend Speicherplatz zur Verfügung haben. Wie viele Kameras Sie in Ihrem Cloud Account hinzufügen, ist und egal. So können Sie eine 10GB Einheit z.B. auch problemlos mit 4 Kameras verwenden. Dies ist natürlich davon abhängig wie viele Alarme stattfinden und wie lange Sie die Aufnahmen speichern möchten. Die Größe Ihrer Alarmvideos ist von einigen Faktoren abhängig. Um die Größe jedoch gering zu halten ohne größere Qualitätsverluste, empfehlen wir Ihnen in Ihrer Kamera direkt (über die Weboberfläche Ihrer Kamera) folgende Werte unter Multimedia – Video einzustellen: Kanal: 1 Bitrate: 1024 Frames: 25 Variable Bitrate: Qualität: 5 (keine Sorge, Sie werden den Unterschied an sich nicht sehen) Keyframe: 40",
