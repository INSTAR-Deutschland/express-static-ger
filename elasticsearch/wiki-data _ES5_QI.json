    "description": "The Angry IP Scanner Angry IP scanner is a very fast IP address and port scanner. It is cross-platform and lightweight. Not requiring any installations, it can be freely copied and used anywhere. Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, then optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. Alternative IP Scanner How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool(Windows), IP Camera Tool(MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool(Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically(DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:Angry IP Scanner(Windows/MacOSX/Linux) You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address(see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan. You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network(marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button. Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model). Congratulations!You now entered the cameras Web User Interface.",

If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is Fing Mobile(Android/iOS) Fing for Android The newest version of the freeware Android App Fing can be found on Google Play. After installation you will see the following interface. Let the Fing scan your network for a new active host. Make sure the camera is disconnected from your network - then start a scan. Now connect the camera and re-run the scan. The camera should show up as a new network device. Press the cameras IP address to open the advanced details. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. Let the Fing scan the host for active services. Please choose Scan services to discover the cameras http port - the default http port is 80. Choose the cameras web port 80.... Press the http port and choose to open the camera´s Web User Interface. ...and choose to open the address inside your default web browser. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model). Congratulations! You now entered the cameras WebUI. Login with the default username and password. Fing Mobile (Android/iOS) Fing for iOS The newest version of the freeware iOS App Fing can be found on the App Store. After installation you will see the following interface. Let the Fing scan your network for a new active host. Make sure the camera is disconnected from your network - then start a scan.

    "description": "Display your Cameras Video inside your Browser. Video Plugins: All INSTAR HD cameras can display their video stream inside a modern web browser (like Firefox, Chrome or Edge) without the need for a video plugin. Just activate the MJPEG mode for this - e.g. in the Multimedia/Video Menu of your 720p camera. But you will loose the h.264 video compression and might start to suffer from bandwidth bottlenecks inside your network. We hightly recommend, that you should install the Flash Video Plugin and use the h.264 videostream instead. This plugin is already installed on most systems and your camera is configured to use it by default - you should be able to see the video stream at once, after loading your cameras web user interface. Other Options: If for some reason you cannot use the Flash Video Plugin, there are three more options to display the video stream inside a web browser. You can use the Quick Time Plugin, an ActiveX Plugin (only works with Internet Explorer and Firefox) that comes with a couple of perks or use the above mentioned MJPEG mode to avoid using plugins all together. ActiveX Plugin -  Windows video plugin (IE and FF). QuickTime Plugin - Plugin for Windows and macOS. MJPEG Mode - Use this mode in Microsoft Edge. Troubleshooting The video plugin might be blocked by your Firewall or Virus scanner. The following articles will explain how to set up your security software to unblock it.
