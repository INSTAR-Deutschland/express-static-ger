    "description2": "Side Navigation - Camera List. The camera list displays all added cameras for an easy configuration. Besides network IP camera, you can also add USB webcams and remote instances of the InstarVision Surveillance System. Just click on the + button at the bottom or right-click on Camera to open the Add Camera dialogue: Add Cameras: The Add Camera menu allows you to add three different types of cameras. A USB camera can be the camera on the laptop the Surveillance Center is installed on. Or Webcams connected to your servers USB interface. Network Cameras are IP cameras on your local network (e.g. local IP´s like 192.168.1.101) as well as cameras you want to connect to over the internet (e.g. DDNS addresses like abcd12.ddns-instar.de). The InstarVision Remote Access refers to a function of the Surveillance Center that enables you to connect to a second remote InstarVision installation. The list order defines the camera viewport arrangement on the video canvas. Add: Just click on the + button or right-click Camera in the Camera List. Add Camera. Edit: Right-click a camera to edit your camera settings and setup. Or delete duplicate your camera Add Camera. Rename: Left-click a camera twice to rename it. Or right-click it and change the name inside the Properties menu. Right-Click an added camera in the list to deactivate, delete or duplicate it. The properties option allows you to adjust its network and video parameters, which were set when you added the camera. Under Bitrate you can adjust the quality of the video stream that is retrieved from the camera. Please be aware that high quality settings result in high bandwidth requirements - as well as high demands on your computers CPU. Add USB Webcams: InstarVision 2.0 - Add USB Camera The InstarVision Surveillance Center automatically detects cameras attached to the PC or laptop. Just select the video and audio source from the list and click OK, to add it to your Camera List. If you are using video capture cards, please install a WDM driver for it to live stream the video. In case of camcorders or external USB Webcams, please attach them to your PC´s USB interface and restart your PC to make them available as a video source. The video source you add here, will be available for all advanced features of the Surveillance Center - turning your laptop camera into a full-fledged Surveillance System. You want to know if someone uses your Laptop or enters your office without permission? The InstarVision Surveillance Center is the solution for your peace of mind. Add Network IP Cameras: InstarVision 2.0 - Add IP Camera: The InstarVision Surveillance Center automatically detects INSTAR HD and VGA cameras on your local network. Open the Search window, select your camera type (HD or VGA) and click on search. Selecting a camera from the list automatically fills out the needed parameters above. Please adjust the camera model and your private camera login - you don´t have to change the Video Audio Access or Ports anymore. Then click OK to add the camera to your Camera List. If you want to add a camera that is not on your local network, it is best practice to simply add a local camera first, duplicate it in the camera list and then change the IP address to the Internet Address (DDNS) of your remote camera and adjust the Port and Login. The default Video Access Name for INSTAR IP cameras is livestream 11?action=play&media=video_audio_data for HD and videostream.cgi for VGA cameras. If you want to add a third-party camera, please adjust the video and audio path according to your manufactures documentation. The Search function might work - if your third-party camera uses the same chipset as an INSTAR camera. But it is more likely that you have to type in the parameters manually. You can also check the iSpy Database for the most common third-party camera models. Add a Remote Instance: InstarVision 2.0 - Add Remote Instance. The InstarVision Surveillance Center allows you to stream videos to the internet. You can use this function to stream video from one installation of the Software to another and add those streams as remote cameras. This enables you to stream all your cameras from site A to site B through one open TCP port in your firewall - if you would connect each camera directly via it´s DDNS address, each camera needs a unique port forwarded to its IP address. This also helps you to manage your network resources more efficient and secure by letting your local Surveillance Center access your local cameras. While your camera limits the amount of simultaneous streams to 3, the server you use to run the Surveillance Center will not confront you with such strong restrictions. Remember that you can still use the DDNS address of one of the remote camera to connect to the remote Surveillance Center. Just type in the camera´s DDNS address and add the port that you forwarded to the server IP address in the remote network. You can change the Surveillance Centers Server port in the System settings.Camera Viewport: You can add up to 64 cameras to the InstarVision Surveillance Center (depending on your license type). Each camera will be displayed in its own viewport on the left of the side navigation. The amount of cameras displayed can be adjusted in the Layout menu. Each viewport offers you a couple of functions to control your camera. InstarVision 2.0 - Camera Viewport: The viewport on-screen display shows you the name of the channel and six channel status buttons. You can double-click the video with left mouse to maximize the camera´s viewport or restore it back to the multi view. A right mouse click opens the viewport layout in a full screen mode - or restores it. Your mouse wheel allows you to digitally zoom in or out of the camera view. While zoomed-in, you are able to drag the image with your left mouse button to pan or tilt your camera virtually. The virtual Zoom Factor will be displayed above the live video, once the Zoom is active. The viewport further offers you the following control elements in the onscreen display.IR LEDs Switch your camera´s nightvision LED´s on and off. Maximize Viewport This button maximizes viewport for the selected camera or restores the video to normal. The function is can also be triggered by double-clicking the video area with left mouse.

    "description2": "Side Navigation - Webserver: InstarVision 2.0 Surveillance Center User Interface - Webserver. If you want to broadcast your camera´s video on your website, simply use the Webserver menu to create the necessary HTML code. Use the InstarVision Surveillance Center to publish your cameras on your local network or the internet. The software offers a web service that you can reach by accessing the local server IP address on another PC on the same network. In the given example, the server address is 192.168.1.18. Just access a different workstation on your network, open the default web browser and type in http: 192.168.1.18 to open the InstarVision web user interface. In case you want to check the webUI from the server itself, open your browser and type in http: localhost or http: 127.0.0.1. The default web server port is 80 - please change it to something above 8080 in case the web user interface does not show (see below). The web server port has to be added to the IP address, if it is not 80 - e.g. http: 192.168.1.18:8081 or http: localhost:8081 ! The default login admin instar can be changed in the User Menu. To access the web user interface from the internet, first click on the Internet IP button to resolve your WAN IP address, then forward a port inside your router to the IP address of your InstarVision Server. You will be able to access the interface from the internet by using your internet IP followed by the forwarded port that you choose in the System settings. The default web server port is set to be 80. Please go to the System Settings to change the web port to the port that you forwarded inside your router´s NAT firewall. We recommend to use ports that are higher than 8080. The Internet Address of your internet access is most likely to change every 24h - please use the DDNS address of your INSTAR IP camera to access the software instead (see below). admin - Default Username. instar - Default Password. Choose the right Video Plugin. ActiveX Plugin  ActiveX Plugin: The ActiveX viewer mode can display up to 32 video channels at once on your webpage - please click on Setup to configure the plugin to your needs. Your web site user is required to install the ActiveX plugin, when he enters the web site for the first time. The ActiveX plugin is only supported by Microsoft´s Internet Explorer. If you want to use Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari or Chrome, please select a different plugin - or go plugin-free using the Simple JPEG mode. WMP Plugin  Windows Player Plugin: This view mode will use Windows Media Player to display your camera´s video - that means, it will only work under Microsoft Windows with the Windows Media Player installed! Also the recording video file format of the Surveillance Center has to be set to ASF or WMV for the channel that you want to broadcast. To change the file format go to the General Recording Settings, select the desired channel and choose the format from the drop down menu. Quicktime Plugin  QuickTime Plugin: This view mode will use the Quicktime Player web plugin to display your camera´s video. Please install and setup the Quicktime Player on your PC or MAC to be able to receive a video stream from an IP camera (set the streaming protocol to HTTP Port 80). Also the recording video file format of the Surveillance Center has to be set to MP4 or MOV for the channel that you want to broadcast. To change the file format go to the General Recording Settings, select the desired channel and choose the format from the drop down menu. RealPlayer Plugin  RealPlayer Plugin: This view mode will use the RealPlayer web plugin to display your camera´s video. Please install the RealPlayer on your PC or MAC to access the video stream and forward the RTSP port to the Surveillance Center - the RealPlayer uses the RTSP stream (default port 554) instead of streaming HTTP port (default 80). Also the recording video file format of the Surveillance Center has to be set to MP4 or MOV for the channel that you want to broadcast. To change the file format go to the General Recording Settings, select the desired channel and choose the format from the drop down menu. Flash Plugin  Flash Plugin: This viewer will use Flash player to display your camera´s video stream. You must install the Adobe Flash plugin in your browser. Also the recording video file format of the Surveillance Center has to be set to FLV for the channel that you want to broadcast. To change the file format go to the General Recording Settings, select the desired channel and choose the format from the drop down menu. Simple JPEG Mode  Simple JPEG Mode: This viewer will simply get single JPEG frames from your camera´s live stream and display them in a continuous fashion to create a video. Due to the nature of this process, there will be no audio signal from your camera. But you won´t need any Plugins to display the video! Portforwarding & DDNS All these broadcasting modes need you to forward the software HTTP (or RTSP) port to the server that runs the Surveillance Center. Please refer to our forwarding instruction for further information - note: in these instructions, we forward a port directly to each camera you want to access. In case of the Surveillance Center broadcast we only need to forward one port (HTTP or RTSP) directly to the server that runs the software and are able to access all camera streams maintained by the Surveillance Center! Remember that you can still use your camera´s DDNS address to access the software - just type in the DDNS address of your camera (that is operated on the same network as the Surveillance Center) and add the port that you forwarded to your server. E.g. if your camera is accessible from the internet via the address abcd12.ddns-instar.de:8081 and you forwarded port 8082 to the server, use type in http: abcd12.ddns-instar.de:8082 to access the software web user interface! Give me an Example: InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 1 Go to the System Menu and change the Webserver Port to a port higher than 8080. You can also deactivate the required login here. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 2 Open the Webserver Menu to check your local IP address and type it into your web browser, followed by the Webserver Port. The default login is admin instar. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 3 Wait for the web user interface to load and choose the Simple JPEG Viewer - this is the only mode that does not require a browser plugin to display the video. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 4 Use the drop-down menu to switch between your camera channels. And the PTZ control pad to pan & tilt your camera (if supported by your model). InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 5 In Internet Explorer choose the ActiveX Viewer and install the ActiveX plugin. Please make sure the plugin is not blocked by your Antivirus Firewall. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 6 The ActiveX Viewer can display up to 32 cameras at the same time. Click on the Setup button to further configure the plugin to your needs. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 5 To embed the web broadcast in your website, choose your Viewer in the Webserver Menu. The template files will be saved in your REC Directory. InstarVision 2.0 :: Webserver 5 The templates will contain the local IP of your server - please swap this for your DDNS address to access your server over the internet!",

    "description2": "Side Navigation - General Recording Settings: InstarVision 2.0 Surveillance Center User Interface - Record Menu. Storage Management. RECORD DIRECTORIES You have to set a recording directory first before executing any functions that write files to your hard drive. By default your Document folder will be selected. If your server uses more than one hard drive, you can set several directories - it is recommended to avoid using the main hard drive (Operating System Partition) for data storage. The software will then automatically jump to the next directory, in case the active hard drive does not have any space left (Overflow). Use the Up and Down Arrows to adjust the list positions and order that your directories will be used in. To be able to use network storage devices, they have to be mapped (show up like local hard drives in Windows Explorer) in Windows - see tutorial here. Recording Directories: The colour, in which the directory is displayed, corresponds to the following: Orange: Active recording directory. Black: Backup directory - the software will automatically switch to the next backup directory once the active directory becomes unavailable or the capacity of the drive is reached. Red: Directory unavailable. STORAGE MANAGEMENT InstarVision can automatically delete old recordings after a certain amount of days. Activate Auto Deletion and set the number of days you need to save your recordings. Video Recording: VIDEO ENCODING Set the file format, media codec and quality parameters for your video recordings for each channel. It is recommended to use the same encoding that is used by the camera - e.g. for INSTAR HD cameras the videos streams will be h.264 mp3 - this way, the software does not have to re-encode the stream and the processor load will be minimized. It is also recommended to use small time increments for the Create New File Every value, to minimize the damage in case a file becomes corrupted. You can also display a time stamp (On-Screen Display) if you deactivated this function inside the camera. The Soft-OSD for the MP4, AVI and MKV container further reduces the computing requirements compared to the hardcoded version. Corrupted video files after a software crash. In case the video recording function of the software is interrupted, e.g. due to a PC crash, the video will not be finalized and your video player might not be able to render it! But in most cases a free programm like the VLC Player will still be able to play parts of the file. We recommend that you use the AVI container for your recordings and choose a filesize that is as small short as possible to avoid data loss. Both the robust AVI recording format and a short recording length will increase your data security.",

Don´t select areas that might cause false alerts - like moving trees or busy streets in the background. Activate the Motion Test (detections that would cause an alert will now be highlighted in the preview window) and adjust the Detection Sensitivity - it is best practice to have someone walk through the frame of your camera and setting the sensitivity to be triggered by this event. A good starting point for the sensitivity is around 50. If you have All Channels selected, the preview window will show you the video image of the first channel - but setings made will be saved for all channels. It is recommended to adjust the sensitivity and detection area for each channel individually, by selecting each camera from the Channel dropdown menu in the top right. ALARM ACTION Activate the alarm recording by checking the Motion Record box. The length of an alarm video is defined by two values - the recording time before and after a motion was detected. Please be aware that activating the recording before detection will cause the software to record constantly, creating a higher system load for your server. This function should only be used when necessary. Please go to the General Recording settings menu to adjust the video recording parameters. Further actions allow you to pop-up the minimized software window, playing an audio signal or start another program once a motion alert was triggered.",

Please be aware that old log entries will remain in the language that they were originally written in. Start View: Define the amount of channels you want to be displayed, when you open the Surveillance Center and adjust if you want the software to be started normally, minimized, full screen or hidden to the tray area. Please activate the Multi-Monitor Support - if you have problems displaying your cameras video on your secondary monitor - and mute the audio to make sure that no audio stream from your server location is send to your cameras by mistake. Display Next Page Every: If you select a viewport layout that offers less ports than you have active channels, let InstarVision switch the displayed cameras automatically. E.g. you have 2 cameras but want to display only one at the time to maximize the viewport size. You can also use the arrow keys in the Layout Menu to switch between channels manually. Web Server Port: The software offers a Web Server to stream your cameras into your local network (or to the internet). The web server port is the HTTP port that you have to use to access the software´s web user interface. E.g. your servers IP address on the local network is 192.168.1.100 and the Surveillance Center web port is set to 8081, simply type http: 192.168.1.100:8081 into your web browsers address bar to access the user interface. Remove the check-mark at Web Server Login if you want to be able to access the web user interface without being asked for a login. RTSP Server Port: The software can broadcast the camera´s video stream via the Real-time Streaming Protocol. Use a streaming software like the VLC Player to access the stream by the following command: rtsp: user password @ ServerAddress : RTSP Port live.sdp?CH=1 Choose the camera channel you want to stream by changing the channel number at the end of the address (the example above - CH=1 will access the stream from the camera assigned to channel 1). Password Protection: The standard login (user: admin & password: instar) is deactivated by default. If you want to activate the login during start-up of the software, set the check-mark here and change the login in the User Menu. Video Mode: If you cannot see the live video of your camera - even though it is connected and you are able to make video recordings - please switch the YUY2 Video Encoding! How to use the Webserver Function InstarVision 2.0 :: Server 1 It is recommended to change the Webserver Port to a port higher than 8080. If you use your web server locally, you might want to deactivate the requirement for a login. It should be kept on if you plan to access the server from the internet. InstarVision 2.0 :: Server 2 Open the Webserver Menu to check your local IP address and type it into your web browser, followed by  the Webserver Port. The default login is admin instar. Follow the link above for more details! How to use the RTSP Stream in VLC Player InstarVision 2.0 :: Server 1 Make sure that InstarVision is running in the background, open the VLC Player - go to the Media Menu and choose to Open Network Stream. You can also just press Ctrl + N to open the network stream dialogue. InstarVision 2.0 :: Server 2 Type in the RTSP stream path (see above) and change the IP/DDNS address, RTSP port and channel (CH=1-64) according to your setup. You can use the local IP address of your InstarVision server from all computer connected to your local network. To access the RTSP stream over the internet, use a DDNS address from your local camera instead and forward the RTSP port to your InstarVision server. InstarVision 2.0 :: Server 3 The RTSP stream should start to run, once you pressed Play. You can also deactivate the requirement for a login - remember to remove the login from the RTSP stream path, if you do.",

    "description2": "Windows Software iSpy Connect iSpy uses your cameras, webcams, IP cams and microphones to detect and record movement or sound. Captured media is compressed to flash video or mp4 and streamed securely over the web and local network. iSpy can run on multiple computers simultaneously and has full Email, SMS and Twitter alerting functions and remote viewing. Some key features are: Unlimited Cameras and Microphones (including IP and USB cameras), Motion Detection (3 types), Motion Processing (4 types), Record on Detection, Record on Schedule, Record with Audio, Remote Access, Network Audio Broadcasting (via iSpy Server), Password Protection, Desktop Recording, YouTube Uploading, SMS, Twitter and Email alerts. In order to integrate your INSTAR IP camera in Spy from ISPYConnect we recommend you to download the latest version from HERE. Add an HD Camera After you installed the newest version of iSpy please open the program. Step 1 Click the Add button and choose IP Camera to add your INSTAR HD camera. Step 2 If want to use the MPEG-Stream then type username and password into the given text fields. Type the complete url into the MPEG-URL field. The url should have the following pattern: http: Camera-IP:Camera-Port videostream.cgi?Parameters. Then press Ok. If want to use the H.264-Stream then type the complete rtsp url into the URL field. The url should have the following pattern: rtsp:username:password@Camera-IP 11Parameters. Then press Ok. Step 3 Type a name for the new added camera into the name text field. Then press Finish. Advanced Settings iSpy comes with a wealth of feature that cannot be covered in detail here. Please refer to the iSpy User Guide for a more in-depth tutorial. Also note that iSpy supports Plugins for added features like License Plate Recognition, Face Recognition, Barcode Scanners, Text Overlays, etc. You can also use the software to make your IP camera available for video chat programs like Skype. The following section is supposed to give you an overview over the advanced features you might want to use with your INSTAR IP camera. You can enter the advanced camera setting by hovering your mouse over the camera video and clicking on the Cog symbol in the context menu. Camera Settings The Camera Settings tab allows you to change basic video options like the frame rate and text overlays. You can also edit the video source if the camera address or login was changed. Add a privacy mask to the video image or activate the microphone function if not activated automatically. Edit basic video and audio option of your camera. Add a black&white image file to the camera to mask areas of the video where privacy is concerned. Motion Detection iSpy comes with a range of different motion detection algorithm built in. Each motion detector has different performance impacts and is suited to different purposes. Two Frames: Probably the most common type you would use. iSpy just compares the last frame to the current frame. Custom Frame: iSpy stores one frame in memory and compares subsequent frames to this - good for detecting if things change - say someone takes a bag out of the scene. Background Modelling: iSpy takes a custom frame but adjusts it over time to morph it towards the current frame. This is good when you have something in your scene that is constantly moving - iSpy will learn to ignore it. Experiment with different motion detection algorithm to find the one that works best for your surveillance. The sensitivity can be set in a Trigger Range, allowing you to set a minimum and maximum level of motion detection. The cut-off function for high detection levels allows you to minimize false alerts due to e.g. changes in lighting conditions (passing cloud during the day or passing car during the night). All changes that effect the whole video image can easily be removed as an alarm trigger by the set upper detection level. The lower level defines the minimum amount of motion that has to occur to trigger an alert. Set an upper and lower detection level cut-off to minimize false alerts. The HSL Filter tells iSpy to ignore certain colours or luminosity ranges when looking for motion. There are many ways this can be useful, for example ignoring constantly moving objects (like trees or clouds) or Tracking objects of a specific colour (like your red car in a parking lot). Use the colour wheel on the left to select a range of colours to either ignore, or track (depending on the dropdown selection for Fill type). You can then specify the minimum and maximum levels for saturation and luminance. A live preview of what the motion detector is seeing is provided on the top right. Here you can see that the detector is set to only look for red colours and ignore everything else - this means that it will only record and alert if something red enters the frame. The HSL Filter allows you to let iSpy either ignore colours or only react to a specific colour in the video frame. iSpy can monitor specific areas of the camera view and ignore others. You can add as many rectangular detection zones as you like (iSpy will only monitor the area within the zones). To add a zone, click and drag out a translucent rectangle. To clear all zones click Clear Zones. Note that with no zones defined iSpy will monitor the entire camera view. Limit the detection zone by drawing rectangular shapes on the video frame. Only motions inside a drawn zone will be detected to reduce false alerts. Alerts iSpy raises alerts for cameras and microphones when it detects movement or sound (you can also raise alerts for no movement or no sound). Mode: Choose between movement no movement or plugin modes. Click the button to configure various settings. Continuous When Motion Detected External Trigger: These options apply to plugins only. For example you may only want to perform license plate recognition (using the plugin) when motion is detected. Actions: Actions to perform on alert - You can add as many actions here as you like. Define a criteria that is used to trigger an alert - the default is to detect movements in the video frame. Define an action that is triggered by a detection - you can add as many actions as you want. Recording iSpy has 4 types of recording mode: No Recording: Triggered manually - either by right-clicking on the camera in iSpy and clicking Record or by clicking Record in iSpyConnect. Record on Detect: Starts recording as soon as motion is detected, regardless of how long the motion has been detected for. Record on Alert: This is very useful for cutting down on the number of recordings if you have set a sensitive motion detect trigger point. Timelapse Recording: iSpy saves a frame on the interval you choose and convert the images to a movie file. Record on detect means record as soon as ispy detects movement. Record on alert means record when ispy generates an alert - alerts can be generated by plugins like face detection or number plate recognition or whatever. Adjust the recording settings for your camera. PTZ Control iSpy includes an XML definition file for controlling PTZ cameras. You can control PTZ for your camera from this panel, or you can control PTZ within iSpy by holding down the middle mouse button on the camera or from the context menu (for advanced commands like turning on off the IR light). If your camera has zoom controls you can use the mouse wheel on the camera to zoom in or out. The PTZ Settings. The PTZ Menu. The PTZ Controller. By the time you read this wiki all of the INSTAR cameras might be integrated in the iSpy XML file. If not, just add the following commands to the file to get your camera´s PTZ working: PTZ Control: Commands The PTZ commands in iSpy don´t seem to work for our HD models at the moment. Please add your HD camera as an ONVIF cameras - when you are using the wizard to add a new camera, simply choose ONVIF as camera manufacturer. This will automatically choose the ONVIF profile inside the PTZ menu. If you are accesing your camera over the internet, please don´t forget to forward the ONVIF port inside the local router: The default ONVIF port is 8080!",

    "description2": "Windows & macOS Software Sighthound Sighthound Video is surveillance software for homes and businesses that has been trained to recognize people and objects. Most off‐the‐shelf security applications available in consumer channels use motion detection to determine if moving objects are present in video. Motion detection analyzes how many pixels have changed between frames. When enough pixels change, video is recorded and or the customer is notified of a motion event. Unfortunately, pixels can also change with clouds passing overhead, leaves swaying in the wind, or flickering lights. More advanced systems let customers ignore selected regions in the video, or set sensitivity levels. Nevertheless, motion detection often generates an unacceptable number of false alerts. Computer vision isn’t based on pixels moving, it works by learning what certain objects look like, in much the same way as a child learns. Computer vision can detect, track and recognize objects in a way that motion detectors can never achieve. In order to integrate your INSTAR IP camera in Sighthound we recommend you to download the latest version from HERE. Add a Camera After you installed the newest version of Sighthound please open the program, click the to add a new camera and choose your INSTAR camera model.

Live Video Check your cameras live video and control it´s pan & tilt movement. You can check the cameras live Video by selecting the camera from the side menu. If you experience problems with the frame rate or the stream breaks up - please adjust the video quality of the camera for a lower bandwidth requirements. Go to Video/Properties (see Screenshots in the chapter above) to select a stream appropriated for your network environment. E.g. for HD cameras set the parameter Uri from 11 (high quality) to 12 (medium quality) or 13 (low bandwidth). If you are using the MJPEG stream of your HD camera, set it´s -chn from 11 to 12 or 13 respectively. You can also adjust the video parameter inside the camera´s web user interface to fit your needs. Motion Detection go1984 includes high-performance motion detection based on an optimized image difference process. When motion detection is triggered, the so-called Motion signal is activated for this camera. This signal can be used, for instance, to begin recording, to launch an FTP upload or to trigger an alarm. Motion areas are highlighted in the live image with red squares. As soon as the actual value exceeds the specified threshold, the motion signal is triggered. The specified threshold (yellow) and current actual value (green or red) are graphically represented by two colored bars in the program to make adjustments easier for you. The actual value bar changes from green to red if a motion has been detected. The circle in the Motion field also turns red. You ll be shown the live image from the camera, with motion areas being marked by red rectangles. As soon as the actual value surpasses the specified limit value, the motion signal is triggered. The specified limit value (yellow) and the current actual value (green or red) are graphically represented by two colored bars in the program in order to make adjustment easier for you. The actual value bar changes from green to red if a motion has been detected. The circle in the Motion field also lights up in red. It often makes sense to exclude certain areas of the camera image from motion detection. In order to do so, you can draw any kind of mask over the image. Various tools are available for doing so. The mask is displayed on the screen transparently for control purposes. Grayed out areas will be excluded from now on. For normal purposes, motion detection settings do not need to be adjusted more than described above. If the default values dont work perfectly for your needs, you ll find additional setup options on the Properties tab. Please check your go1984 user manual for more details. Storage Management go1984 includes efficient ring storage. This enables you to optimize available hard-drive space allocation to the cameras, thereby ensuring that there is always enough memory space available for new recordings. go1984 is able to delete the oldest recordings automatically after the allotted memory has been used up. You can also select an individual recording directory by clicking on the folder icon in the Storage tab under Recording directory. Email Notification Select the entry Notification in the go1984 explorer. You can now enter one or several recipients (separated by semicolons) into the field E-mail address. Adjust the subject line if you wish. The variable %cameraname% is automatically replaced by the name of the camera triggering the alarm when an e-mail is sent. You have the option to set a rest period which must elapse between sending two e-mails, by clicking on the clock icon. Simply click on the clock icon and then set the rest period you want. FTP Upload If you wish the images from a camera to be sent to an FTP server in addition to being stored locally, complete the following dialog. First, enter the login data for your FTP server: FTP Server: Domain name or IP of your FTP server, e.g. ftp.online.com Port: FTP port, almost always 21 FTP user ID: Username for logging on to the FTP server FTP password: Password for logging on to the FTP server FTP directory: FTP server subdirectory where you want the images to be saved Passive mode: If your FTP server cannot be run in the active mode, select this option Keep connection: After uploading an image, the connection to the FTP server is kept open. If you prefer the connection to be shut, deactivate this option. You can also choose to resize images before saving them on the FTP server. Activate this option and define the new size of the image using the corresponding fields.",

Add a new video source by URL. Motion Detection ZoneTrigger, as the softwares name might suggest, employs trigger zones that you can freely position on top of the video. The default is a round shaped hot spot that uses a software based motion detection to trigger an alarm event. This is the simplest and most versatile technique. The software looks for any difference between frames by comparing pixel color and brightness without trying to identify anything. These differences can be caused by moving objects, lights on off, shadows, and even vibrations. You can quickly assign an action to an event like recording a video, uploading a snapshot to an FTP server or sending a notification email. Add a new video source by URL. There are a lot more Triggers, beside the simple Motion Detection that can be employed to your surveillance task. Like Flow Control which determines in which direction people are travelling, a Level Measure or a Pattern Matching that tries to match the input image to a reference image to figure out the state of certain objects.

The Camera View Window You can access the Camera View by clicking on a camera video in the Multiview window. You will have access to different button layouts depending on the available camera functions of your camera model. Simply tap on the two arrows in the lower left corner to switch between different layouts. You can access the Camera View by clicking on a camera video in the Multiview window. Bandwidth Conservation: JPG Mode TinyCam Monitor does not support the h.264 video stream of HD cameras at the moment - all cameras are treated as MJPEG cameras which leads to high bandwidth demands in case of an HD camera model. But you can use the JPG mode to preserve your bandwidth. Open the Advanced Settings and search for the JPEG Image Address. You can use the following two addresses - the first one will grab the full resolution 1280x720 pixel snapshot, while the second one uses a compressed JPG file that usually is more then enough for a small smartphone screen: http: IP or DDNS address of your camera tmpfs snap.jpg 1280x720 Resolution http: IP or DDNS address of your camera tmpfs auto.jpg 320x176 Resolution Open the advanced settings to set the JPG image address. The tmpfs snap.jpg path will give you the full resolution JPG stream. The tmpfs auto.jpg path will give you the compressed JPG stream.",
