Remote controlled camera head,, 5.) PIR heat detector for advanced motion detection, 6.) Audio Out (3.5mm Headphone Jack), 7.) RJ45 Ethernet connector, 8.) Wifi antenna connector, 9.) SD card, 10.) Camera Reset, 11.) Status LED, 12.) DC power supply connector. Click here for detailed specifications. The IN-6014HD is an all round solution for indoor surveillance. The camera head is remotely controllable and equipped with infrared diodes to utilize night vision in pitch dark environments. The integrated IR cut filter on the other hand allows for the capturing of native colours, as seen by the human eye. Through the use of an efficient h.264 compression codec it is able of recording video files on SD memory card with comparably small size but best picture results. Any device (i.e. smartphones) can connect to the cameras web interface and allows you to control the pan  tilt feature. With 350 degree horizontally and 100 degree vertically range of movement. Thanks to its compact size and its modern design you won t be just limited to use it as a surveillance camera but also for your personal projects. The FTP support allows you to use the IN-6014 HD as a multi functional webcam for integration on your website. Hardware: Integrated PIR heat detector for advanced motion detection. Remote controlled Pan Tilt - 350° pan and 100° tilt. 2-Way audio via an integrated microphone and speakers. Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) HD 720p colour CMOS Sensor. Network: RJ-45 Ethernet port for an easy integration into your 100Mbit home network. Compatible with Wifi IEEE 802.11 b g n up to 54Mbit networks with WEP, WPA and WPA2 security. DHCP and UPnP support for an automatic network integration. Integrated individual DDNS (Internet) address to access your camera through the Internet. Software: Free Android, iPhone and Windows Phone 8 App. Web user interface allows an easy configuration and canera control through your default web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer). Multi user management and simultaneous login for 3 users. Software-based motion and audio detection and email notification with attached snapshots. Record videos directly on your PC (only ActiveX). The IN-6014 HD is the first INSTAR HD 720p pan tilt camera with an integrated infrared motion detector. The camera can easily be controlled through your smartphone from inside your network and also over the internet. The camera can easily be connected to your network by using its 54MBit (802.11b g) Wi-Fi module (WPA WPA2) or through the 100MBit network interface to ensure a fluid video stream. The camera can also see during the night thanks to 12 Infrared LEDs operating at a wavelength of 850nm. The max. indoor range for the cameras night vision is around 10-15 meters. Our new HD indoor camera will bring you all the features that you are used to from our VGA series, combined with a superior resolution of 1280x720 Pixel and the possibility to record videos on an integrated SD card. The IN-6014 HD is the camera that combines the powerful software based motion detection with a hardware heat motion detector (PIR). Both methods can be used or bundled to increase their effectiveness by minimizing their false alarm rate. The 1 3 inch WDR sensor is built on a 4.3 micron OmniPixel3-HS™ Pixel enabling 720p HD at unparalleled low-light sensitivity and a dynamic range in colour of 115 dB – compared to the 60 db of a regular VGA IP Camera. WDR allows you to capture high detailed colour videos even in high-contrast environmental lighting conditions.",

Plug in the power supply (7) to start the camera. It is recommended to set your wifi router to a band in the range from 1-6 (802.11bgn). Also WPA2 AES (CCMP) encryption should be used. A Press the WPS button (s. above) on your router. B Press the camera´s reset button for 3s (image on the left). Be aware that holding it for longer than 10s will result in a camera reset. C The camera will now automatically connect to your Wifi network. Please skip to step 7 (for PC or Mac) or 14 (for smartphone). Connect the network cable to the back of the camera (s. 12) to setup a LAN connection (also necessary for Wifi if WPS is not available s. 4 above).
